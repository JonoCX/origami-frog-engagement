# Investigating User Engagement with an Interactive Tutorial

The repository contains the notebooks and data that were used to investigate user engagement with 
the [BBC Make-Along: Origami Frog](https://www.bbc.co.uk/taster/pilots/origamimakealong) interactive media experience.

To run the notebooks, you'll first need create the necessary virtual environment and install the required 
libraries (use either venv with requirements.txt or conda with environment.yml).

**This repository is semi-active, use the release version of the code to get the snapshot that was used
to perform the original analysis.**
